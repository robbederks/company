company_name = "Argus, Inc."
company_story = f"""
{company_name} is a SF startup that is building a web app to unify different security cameras, like Wyze, Nest, Ring, Blink, ... .
This is done by developing a minimal custom firmware for each camera type that is easy to install and that streams the video to a central server.
The server then uses state-of-the-art machine learning to detect and classify interesting events.
The app then allows the user to view the events and manage the cameras. Footage can be stored for a subscription fee.

Every word in every meeting costs the company money. As a result, employees are encouraged to be as concise as possible, if not, they will be fired.
